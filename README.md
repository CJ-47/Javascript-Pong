# Javascript-Pong
In this project , we create the popular computer game "Pong" using JavaScript ,HTML and CSS .
The Project is deployed at link : 
https://cj-47.github.io/Javascript-Pong/

Implemented the Gameplay Logic .

It uses MouseMove Event listener to detect 1st player (Human's) paddle movement.
However , the implementedlogic makes the second player (Computer) a perfect player and 
we need to either intentionally create some mismovements to make it lose points ,
Else, we can modify it as 2 human player by using Keydown Event Listener.
